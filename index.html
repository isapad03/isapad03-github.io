Dear Editor,


 Hello! I have been reading your magazine and I just wanted to write to say what a great magazine it is and to ask a few questions. I am wondering how to use iCloud on my phone. Whenever I try to do anything with it I never can figure anything out!  

I just got a new phone for the first time ever and I need help setting up all my iCloud stuff. If I upload everything to iCloud and sign in on my new phone will it really save all my stuff??? I am sending you my credit card number and all my account usernames and passwords so you can help. 

From, John

Dear John

First I will tell you what iCloud actually is. iCloud is a server that stores your information and keeps it safe even if your phone gets deleted or something. It can also be used to transfer data from a old phone to a new one. Now that you know what iCloud is I can show you how to get the stuff on your old phone on the new one.

<h1 id= "title">Bringing People to Christ Through Technology</h1>

A graphic designer and his wife lived in Southern Indiana and worked for a local church to create slides and materials, but they felt like God wanted them to work somewhere else. They didn’t know where God wanted them, but when an opportunity came up to be missionaries in New York City they took a leap of faith and went.
 
There they worked among the Wolof people trying to share the Gospel. However they couldn’t get traction in their work and still felt like it wasn’t where God wanted them. At first, they wondered if they felt unsettled because the rent in New York was too high. They prayed that God would show them what to do. Later a new place opened for rent. It cost almost nothing to stay there and was large enough so they moved in and continued their work. Strangely, they still felt a sense that this was not where they belonged. So they began searching for other countries to move to for mission work. 

After praying they decided to go to a middle eastern country where they would be able to use their technology skills. While there they created a facebook page that would walk people who are seeking for truth through the story of Christ. If someone was interested, the page gave information to contact a local missionary to talk more about the Gospel. Unknown to the graphic designer and his wife there was a man named Hakeem in the country they moved to who the Lord wanted to save through their work.

Hakeem went to college where there was an open Muslim teacher who invited a Christian to come speak in his class. Hakeem noticed that whenever this Christian man spoke he felt peace. Since he was hearing a lot of new information he began researching about the Gospel for himself. Wanting others to know about this, he began sharing with his family who were very strict muslims. His family began pushing back against him. In his last year of school, he met another Christian man and began studying the Bible with him.

When his family found out about his studies with a Christian they kicked him out of the house. Hakeem was forced to move to a different city. In this city he met a muslim woman and was married. However, when the woman’s family found out Hakeem was a Christian they forced him to divorce their daughter. Now he was all alone and didn’t know any other Christians in the city. 

Seeking someone to give him a Bible and baptize him he went to the only church around which was a French cathedral left from when the French had occupied his country. This was illegal because it was a Christian cathedral in a muslim country. He tried to get in four different times only wanting to get a Bible and be baptized. After being kicked out all four times he turned to the Internet desperate for help. He found the Facebook page of the graphic designer and his wife and within forty eight hours was able to receive his first Bible and be baptized. 

Today Hakeem is a strong believer and encourages other believers by praying and studying the Bible with them. The graphic designer and his wife are still using technology to share the gospel. They have created with other missionaries two discipling websites and an app that allows seekers to learn about the Gospel and talk with local missionaries. Surely there are more people like Hakeem who are seeking the truth and will come to Christ through technology.

“Mom can I go play games on the computer?”
“Yes, but first do your dishes.”
“Yay! Thanks Mom!”
I hurried to wash my dishes, ran upstairs to where the family computer was and started playing. 
After about an hour I was on the last level. I had just gotten the power up and I was going to strike my final blow on the giant dragon that was trying to burn up my village. Just then a message appeared on the screen and before I could read it the computer screen turned black. Strange words appeared on the screen.
”Hey Dad, the computer just did something weird,” I shouted down the stairs. 
“Ok I will be there in a minute,” he said. 
Just then the computer flashed back on, but something was wrong. All of the apps and files were gone! All that was on the screen was a message telling me to download a security program. I was about to yell for dad again when I noticed something strange. The house was quiet. I couldn’t hear mom doing the dishes or the neighbor’s dog barking.
 “Weird,” I thought.
 “What’s going on?”
 I hesitantly clicked on the download link and the message disappeared. Everything looked like it was back to normal. Except for the strange silence, I couldn’t even hear the wall clock ticking. After a few seconds another error message appeared.
“Good grief! Whats with all these error messages!” I exclaimed.
 The message had a strange line of numbers and letters.
 “looks like sone kind of code,” I muttered.
 Below the code there were two buttons, one labeled “Run” and another labeled “Cancel.” I clicked on “Run” and there was a sound like a large motor spinning up. The pitch got higher and higher, then I felt a strange pulling and squishing sensation. It felt like I was being sucked through a small hole. Then came a white flash and after that nothing but darkness.


When I woke up I didn’t know where I was, it was totally dark except for an eerie blue glow that seemed to come from the air itself. The floor and walls were solid cold metal.
 “Where in the world am I?” 
I looked around trying to get my bearings. The light was just enough to be able to see. In front of me was a large metal platform. I walked toward it and pulled myself up. On the top was printed Lg a9 intelligent processor.  
“But thats not possible!” I exclaimed
 “If thats what I think it is than that means…I’m inside the computer!”
 Just then I remembered what Dad had said to me 
“were getting a new computer tomorrow. It will be delivered around 9pm,”
 Hurriedly I checked my watch. 1:24 am. 
“I’ve only got around 19 hours until we get a new computer. When we do we are going to wipe this one and give it away. I’ve got to get out by then. But where can I get out from?”
 I had a difficult decision to make. Either hide and try to survive the wipe and then escape. Or try to escape and risk not making it out in time. 
“I know what to do. I have to escape somewhere.”
 I thought back over the diagrams of the computer that I had seen. 
“If this is the processor then I can get out through the speaker grille… that way”

I set off at once in the direction of where I assumed I could escape. After a while I checked my watch again. 12:30 pm. 
“Oh no! I’ve already used up 10 hours of my time! I have to go faster.”
 Suddenly the blue light I had been using to find my way was gone. It was pitch black. I couldn’t see my hand if it was a foot in front of my face! 
“great” I thought
 “how will I get out now?”
 I waited in the dark for a few minutes to let my eyes adjust. I still could not see enough to walk around butt I had to go on. I picked my way carefully around corners and down long dark passages. I started wondering whether I was going the right way at all. 
“It seems like I’ve been walking forever. I think I should be there by now.”
 I turned around to try to get my bearings and immediately realized my mistake. Now I didn’t have any idea which way I should be going. 
“uh oh. What am I going to do now! I just have to pick a direction and go with it”
 So I started walking and hoped it would lead me out. I had been walking for a while when I heard a strange sound. It reminded me of a watch ticking but louder and higher. 
“I know iv’e heard that before.”  I wondered
 “What is it?”
 Suddenly it came to me. It was the sound the computer made when we first got it. Dad had told me it was the hard drive getting ready to start up. 
“Oh no, this must be the computer starting to wipe. Ive got to get out of here!”
 Just then I noticed a light in the distance
”That must be the way out!”
  I started running toward the light. Suddenly I ran into a hard metal wall


The light I had seen before was coming from the wall I had just ran in to.
 “Ow” I mumbled. I stepped back to look at the light and to my dismay it was no way out al all! 
“Well, that’s nice. This was the wrong way after all. Now I have no idea where I am!”       
 Just then The blue light returned but this time it was different. It was brighter and was accompanied by a fizzing and crackling sound. I craned my neck to see the computer was wiping! I craned my need to see what the song was and I saw arcs of electricity rushing toward me. I knew I would be electrocuted if they reached me so I desperately looked around for somewhere to run. I spotted a passage and sprinted down it. Glancing behind me I saw the bright blue light coming up from behind me. I turned left and saw the way out in front of me! I rushed toward it. Right before I got there I was hit from behind. I fell over and hit my head on the wall and just had time to see a blue glow sweep over my head before everything went dark. It was over.
